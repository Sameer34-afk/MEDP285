                    <h2>History of Chrome</h2>
                    <p>The word "chrome" originates from the Greek word "Chroma", meaning color. This may be how it got its name, but its stylistic properties come from the discovery of Chromium as a mineral. Chromium, discovered in 1797 by Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin, was a metal known for its silver-like appearance. Chromium also became essential in covering objects with a thin layer to give that "Chrome" look.</p>

                    <p>Within the 1930s, Chrome was used even more, especially within the automotive industry, and design in general. It was used to coat cars and started receiving the reputation as a futuristic material. This eventually evolved into website design, technology, product design, and the idea that chrome represented the future was stapled in society.</p>
