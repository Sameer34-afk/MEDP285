<h1> Sameer Alam</h1>
<h2> Emerging Media / Arts Management and Business Certificate</h2>
<h3> Who Am I?</h3>
<h4> I am a rising senior at Hunter College pursuing a degree in Emerging media. I am also pursuing an Arts Management and Business certificate because it will aid me in developing my organization. My goal is to aid artists/brand owners in executing their artistic visions as well as being able to develop my own. I am a firm believer that to be successful in the creative business you need solid technical skills that are transferrable to different creative mediums. This is why it's extremely important to learn tools such as graphic design, project planning, and web development. Especially in this digital age being able to have the creative technical skills for any scenario is one I plan to be an expert in. This combined with the administration knowledge I will gain from my certificate will allow me to lead a team in the execution of as many creative visions as possible. I am also incredibly interested in interactive media and see it as the future for creative projects.
